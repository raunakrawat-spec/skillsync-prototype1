# SkillSync Backend

Backend API for the SkillSync SIH prototype — a labour-market intelligence
and curriculum-alignment platform. This server powers all five pages of the
frontend: Industry Demand / Roadmap, Career Spotlight, Internships, Q&A, and
Profile.

## Stack

- **Node.js + Express** — REST API
- **SQLite (better-sqlite3)** — zero-setup embedded database (one file, no
  separate DB server to install — swap for Postgres/MySQL later if you need
  to scale, the query layer is isolated in `db.js` and the route files)
- **JWT auth** (`jsonwebtoken` + `bcryptjs`) — signup/login
- **Anthropic API (optional)** — if you set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, roadmap
  generation and the Q&A chatbot call Claude for a richer, personalised,
  day-wise plan. If you don't set a key, everything still works using the
  built-in rule-based matching engine (ported 1:1 from the prototype's
  in-browser JS).

## 1. Install

```bash
cd skillsync-backend
npm install
```

## 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and at minimum change `JWT_SECRET` to a random string. Leave
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` blank if you don't have one yet — the app degrades
gracefully.

## 3. Seed demo data

Populates trending courses, sample companies (with course/skill demand +
internship data), career-spotlight stories, and FAQs — the same data that
was hardcoded in the HTML prototype.

```bash
npm run seed
```

## 4. Run

```bash
npm start
# or, for auto-restart on file changes during development:
npm run dev
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default. Check it's alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/health
```

## API overview

All endpoints are under `/api`. Endpoints marked 🔒 require an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (token comes from register/login).

### Auth
| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | `{ name, email, password }` → `{ token, user }` |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | `{ email, password }` → `{ token, user }` |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` 🔒 | Current user |

### Profile (page 5)
| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/profile` 🔒 | Full profile: level, field, interests, skills, experience, achievements, saved courses |
| PUT | `/api/profile` 🔒 | Upsert `{ level, field, interests[], skills[], time, hours, mode }` |

### Industry demand (page 1 — other tabs)
| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/industry/courses` | Trending courses with demand % |
| GET | `/api/industry/companies?search=&sector=` | Browse companies |
| GET | `/api/industry/companies/:name/course-demand` | Top courses a company hires for |
| GET | `/api/industry/companies/:name/skill-demand` | Top skills a company hires for |

### Career Spotlight (page 2)
| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/spotlight` | All stories |
| GET | `/api/spotlight/:id` | One full story |
| POST | `/api/spotlight` 🔒 | Submit your own story |

### Internships (page 3)
| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/internships?sector=` | Companies taking interns + colleges they visit |
| GET | `/api/internships/standing?skills=Excel,SQL` | Ranks companies by how ready you are, given your (or the passed) skills |

### Q&A (page 4)
| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/qna/questions` | All questions with answers |
| POST | `/api/qna/questions` 🔒 | `{ title, body }` |
| POST | `/api/qna/questions/:id/answer` 🔒 | Human expert answers: `{ body }` |
| POST | `/api/qna/questions/:id/bot-answer` 🔒 | Ask the AI chatbot to answer instead |
| GET | `/api/qna/faqs` | FAQ list |

## How this connects to the frontend

`SkillSync-connected.html` (in the same delivery as this backend) is your
uploaded prototype wired up to call these endpoints instead of only running
in-browser. It expects the API at `http://localhost:4000/api` by default —
change the `API_BASE` constant near the top of its `<script>` block if you
deploy the backend elsewhere, and update `CORS_ORIGIN` in `.env` to match
wherever you host the HTML file.

## Notes on the AI integration

`utils/aiClient.js` calls Claude via the standard Anthropic Messages API. It
is used in two places, both **optional enhancements** with automatic
fallback to deterministic logic so a missing/invalid key never breaks the
app:

1. `POST /api/roadmap/generate` — refines stage descriptions and writes a
   genuine day-by-day plan for week 1 of the roadmap, personalised to the
   trainee's background and hour budget.
2. `POST /api/qna/questions/:id/bot-answer` — answers a trainee's question
   directly when no human expert has replied yet.

## Production notes

- Swap SQLite for Postgres/MySQL by replacing `db.js` — the rest of the
  code only calls `db.prepare(...).run/get/all(...)`, which is easy to
  mirror with `pg`/`mysql2` query builders if you outgrow SQLite.
- Add rate limiting (e.g. `express-rate-limit`) before exposing this
  publicly, especially on `/api/auth/*` and the AI-backed endpoints.
- Consider moving expert verification/roles (`users.role`) into a proper
  admin workflow before letting arbitrary users post Spotlight stories or
  answer questions as "experts".
